# Hamiltonian Mean Field Model

## What is a Hamiltonian Mean Field Model?


The dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with long-range interaction display several
anomalous and intriguing features compared to systems with short-range interaction.
Hamiltonian mean field model (HMF) belongs to this class of systems. This model
represents a conservative system of particles moving in a circle, coupled by a repulsive
or attractive cosine potential. The model is intensely studied in recent years due to its
richness and flexibility in exploring the relations between dynamics and thermodynamics
in many-body systems with long-range interactions. This system shows a second-order
phase transition from a clustered phase to a gaseous one (where the particles are
homogeneously distributed on a circle) as a function of energy.
Prior to reaching its equilibrium state, the system presents several interesting features.
For example, if "water bag" initial condition is chosen for the particles, the relaxation to
the equilibrium becomes very slow.


The relaxation time of this quasistationary states (QSS) diverges with the system size.
